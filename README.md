# AMD Diffusion Distillation

This repository provides training recipes for the AMD Nitro models, a series of efficient text-to-image generation models that are distilled from popular diffusion models on AMD Instinct GPUs.

Compared to the [Stable Diffusion 2.1 base model](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base), we achieve 95.9% reduction in FLOPs at the cost of just 2.5% lower CLIP score and no degradation in FID score.

| Model    | FID &darr; | CLIP &uarr; |FLOPs| Latency on AMD Instinct MI250 (sec)
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
| Stable Diffusion 2.1 base, 50 steps (cfg=7.5) | 25.47   | 0.3286 |83.04 | 4.94
| **Stable Diffusion 2.1 Nitro**, 1 step | 26.04     | 0.3204|3.36 | 0.18

Compared to [PixArt-Sigma](https://pixart-alpha.github.io/PixArt-sigma-project/), our high resolution model achieves a 90.9% reduction in FLOPs at the cost of just 3.7% lower CLIP score and 10.56% higher FID.

| Model    | FID &darr; | CLIP &uarr; |FLOPs| Latency on AMD Instinct MI250 (sec)

| PixArt-Sigma, 20 steps | 34.14   | 0.3289 |187.96 | 7.46

## Environment

### Docker image
Pull the following docker image from [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/pytorch)

``` 
docker pull rocm/pytorch:rocm6.1.3_ubuntu22.04_py3.10_pytorch_release-2.1.2 
```

### Dependencies
Install the core python libraries by

```
pip install diffusers==0.29.2 transformers accelerate wandb torchmetrics pycocotools torchmetrics[image] open-clip-torch
```

## Synthetic data generation

Our models are distilled using synthetic data generated from the base models using prompts from [DiffusionDB](https://huggingface.co/datasets/poloclub/diffusiondb). Follow the instructions in their repo to extract prompts from the dataset and prepare a .txt file where each line corresponds to a prompt. 

We provide a sample list ```data/sample_prompts.txt``` as an example.

#### Generating data from Stable Diffusion 2.1 base
```
bash scripts/run_gen_data.sh
```

#### Generating data from PixArt-Sigma
```
bash scripts/run_gen_data_pixart.sh
```

Please remember to correctly set **"PROMPT_PATH"** and **"OUT_FOLDER"** in the scripts.


## Train models
Use the following bash script to perform distillation:
```
bash scripts/run_train.sh
```

You will need to set:
* `MODEL_NAME`: the base model from which you want to distill an efficient model
* `DATA_ROOT`: the data folder that was generated in the previous step
* Huggingface Accelerate parameters according to your training setup to use the correct number of GPUs and batchsize. You may refer to [Accelerate CLI](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/en/package_reference/cli) for more details.


## Generate images
The distilled models generated by the training script are saved in Diffusers format. Use the following code snippets to perform inference with them:

**Stable Diffusion 2.1 Nitro**
```python
from diffusers import DDPMScheduler, DiffusionPipeline
import torch

scheduler = DDPMScheduler.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base", subfolder="scheduler")
pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base", scheduler=scheduler)

ckpt_path = '<path to distilled checkpoint>'
unet_state_dict = torch.load(ckpt_path)
pipe.unet.load_state_dict(unet_state_dict)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

image = pipe(prompt='a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars',
             num_inference_steps=1,
             guidance_scale=0,
             timesteps=[999]).images[0]
```

**PixArt-Sigma Nitro**
```python
from diffusers import PixArtSigmaPipeline
import torch

pipe = PixArtSigmaPipeline.from_pretrained("PixArt-alpha/PixArt-Sigma-XL-2-1024-MS")

ckpt_path = '<path to distilled checkpoint>'
transformer_state_dict = torch.load(ckpt_path)
pipe.transformer.load_state_dict(unet_state_dict)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

image = pipe(prompt='a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars',
             num_inference_steps=1,
             guidance_scale=0,
             timesteps=[400]).images[0]
```

## Evaluation

**COCO dataset**

Download COCO val2017 images from [here](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2017.zip) and annotations from [here](http://images.cocodataset.org/annotations/annotations_trainval2017.zip)

Create a root folder called `coco` and unzip these two files into this folder. The folder structure looks like:

```
coco/
├── val2017/
└── annotations/

```
To evaluate the model, run:
```
bash scripts/run_eval.sh
```

Please correctly set variables in this script including `COCO_ROOT`, `CKPT_PATH`, `MODEL`, etc. The script will generate 5k images based on 5k unique given prompts from the COCO val2017 dataset, and calculate FID and CLIP scores based on these generated images.
